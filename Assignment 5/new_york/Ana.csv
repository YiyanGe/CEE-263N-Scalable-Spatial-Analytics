2010-12-26 22:15:51,40.807933,-73.928718,@matgod is that like...the whole company or just NYC?
2010-12-26 22:19:12,40.807933,-73.928718,@andrewkpeterson we were supposed to be a regular day, right?
2010-12-26 22:19:44,40.807933,-73.928718,@matgod I don't mind going in, honest. But it'll be so dead if we do. I'll pull my hair out in boredom.
2010-12-26 22:22:24,40.807933,-73.928718,@matgod unrelated, I showed my boyfriend your picture on twitter. I think he's scared.
2010-12-26 22:23:10,40.807933,-73.928718,@Lomichelle @matgod WE NEED A BAT PHONE! Or a code word! Or a secret underground radio station!
2010-12-26 22:29:47,40.807933,-73.928718,@mouthsex no one knows.
2010-12-27 06:59:11,40.807933,-73.928718,So there's a few trains running according to the mta, my car is buried. No metro north trains to CT. Now @i40364 and I wait.
2010-12-27 07:16:40,40.807940,-73.928780,@clarapineda hahaha there are no flights out of NYC either.
2010-12-27 08:16:43,40.807962,-73.928717,@mblumkin you also can walk to work. Lol. I have no idea how I'm gonna make it.
2010-12-27 08:20:12,40.807962,-73.928717,@mblumkin Tim just called in to greenwitch since there's no new haven line trains. No one answered. So he's not sure if they are opening.
2010-12-27 08:24:12,40.807962,-73.928717,@mblumkin that makes sense. Uws is closed until noon.
2010-12-27 08:25:07,40.807962,-73.928717,Hey UWS, looks like we are closes until noon as of right now. I have no other info then that. =) gooodmorning.
2010-12-27 08:47:10,40.807962,-73.928717,@nadiazonis steph texted saying 12. It may change. depends on the mta/bloomburg. Why NJ, MA & Delaware are state of emergency & we aren't...
2010-12-27 09:17:10,40.807962,-73.928717,@nadiazonis not that I know of.

2010-12-27 09:47:39,40.807962,-73.928717,@mblumkin you guys are closed now?
2010-12-27 10:35:26,40.807962,-73.928717,@tinasawaya but will uws still open!!!!???????
2010-12-27 10:40:13,40.807962,-73.928717,@Marinmaid we will see. Tim wants to know what is going on with Greenwich? You say it's closed?
2010-12-27 10:50:12,40.807962,-73.928717,@tinasawaya @marinmaid good to know. No points for Tim!
2010-12-27 10:51:21,40.807962,-73.928717,@tinasawaya I knew they were planning on 12, but it could change if more people cant get to work.
2010-12-27 11:11:50,40.807962,-73.928717,@Lomichelle @tinasawaya @mouthsex @matgod Westchester and Greenwich are closed. Someone explain THAT to me.
2010-12-27 11:14:10,40.807962,-73.928717,Breakfast then we start to shovel.
2010-12-27 14:19:53,40.807962,-73.928717,Oh I see, they decided to start plowing, but just enough to build two snow mountains to block my car in even more.
2010-12-27 16:22:29,40.807962,-73.928717,Still no one has plowed our parking lot.  #3:21 #positivethinking
2010-12-27 19:05:17,40.807962,-73.928717,6 pm. We still aren't plowed. Is this going to be continued until tomorrow?
2010-12-27 21:30:07,40.807934,-73.928721,@andrewkpeterson now I'm really glad I called out. They finally started to plow our parking lot. We will see about tomorrow.
