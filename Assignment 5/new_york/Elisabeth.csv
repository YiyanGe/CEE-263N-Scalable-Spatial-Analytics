2010-11-21 02:30:01,40.720699,-73.985682,@Pdflips I didn't think a hetero side to her existed and evenso, you respect your partner. I think she just has issues, man.
2010-11-21 02:34:47,40.720852,-73.985602,@Pdflips I didn't know all these things! I thought they were spiritual special people. There is noting "in blood," just in upbringing.

2010-11-21 12:56:03,40.720773,-73.985465,@mama730 @Pdflips you guys are discussing moving to a worse and more crime filled neighborhood for weed. what about safety?
2010-11-21 12:59:53,40.720775,-73.985479,@Pdflips I honestly don't get why our entire family even with money stays in the ghetto. she can move to JP or a different part of Dor. then
2010-11-21 13:04:45,40.720770,-73.985495,@Pdflips agreed! That's my point. It shouldn't be a focus on moving back to the hood for weed.
2010-11-21 13:10:40,40.720773,-73.985465,I got juuuust enough sleep so I wouldn't be delusional, now back to writing.

2010-11-21 13:18:53,40.720826,-73.985503,@mama730 well good I like about that many crack dealers, too. If we just don't offend each other we can get along here.
2010-11-21 13:20:06,40.720837,-73.985508,@Pdflips exactly. She's so much more hateful of race than I am, I don't hate anyone's color. How they act is a whole other issue.
2010-11-21 13:23:11,40.720767,-73.985499,@mama730 I guess you didn't get the memo I don't hang with those people. They are dead. We shouldn't practice and recreate their hatred.
2010-11-21 13:24:55,40.720762,-73.985509,@mama730 I've been descriminated at by black and hispanic people much more growing up where I did for just being different.
2010-11-21 13:26:41,40.720776,-73.985483,@mama730 I think it's healthier to let go of those issues. They're all based on very weak theories, no one should choose to hate.
2010-11-21 13:29:46,40.720816,-73.985470,I'm almost done writing this story about two white men being in love and fucking each other, I think @mama730 will LOVE it!!
2010-11-21 13:33:18,40.720766,-73.985479,@mama730 clearly my family doesn't either. I think you should stop and respect my beliefs or not be in my life anymore, choose.
2010-11-21 13:35:19,40.720769,-73.985522,@mama730 I left behind feeling bad about myself for standing up for what I believe in in high school, I'm not doing it as an adult.
2010-11-21 13:36:34,40.720769,-73.985522,@mama730 your theories that slavery happened is fact yes. All white people being evil? That's not fact, some quack writing it doesn't matter
2010-11-21 13:38:07,40.720775,-73.985472,@mama730 my friends care about me way more than you do. they actually respect me and don't try to change me, they don't hate either.
2010-11-21 13:39:09,40.720771,-73.985478,@Pdflips I think so, too, pass it on to your sister. I'm off this.
